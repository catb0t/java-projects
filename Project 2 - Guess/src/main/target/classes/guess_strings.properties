random_fail1       =Aw, you didn't guess it in time.
random_fail2       =Oh, no! You didn't get the answer quick enough.
random_fail3       =Oops, you ran out of guesses. Better luck next time . . .
random_fail4       =You lost! I won! I mean . . .  sorry, no more guesses allowed.
random_fail5       =You lose! My plan work-- Uh, how unfortunate.
random_fail6       =Shucks, you didn't get it right fast enough.

random_guesshigher1=That was too low. Guess higher!
random_guesshigher2=Guess higher!
random_guesshigher3=You are down in the dumps. You should guess higher numbers . . .
random_guesshigher4=That hurt my head . . .  I don't remember the number I was supposed to \
  think of . . .
random_guesshigher5=Ok, that wasn't right. Maybe you should guess a higher number . . .
random_guesshigher6=Too low, please, guess higher.

random_guesslower1 =Too high! Guess lower.
random_guesslower2 =Guess lower!
random_guesslower3 =You are high in the sky. Try a lower number . . .
random_guesslower4 =My head hurts . . .  Your guesses are too high.
random_guesslower5 =I think I forgot the number . . .
random_guesslower6 =That wasn't low enough for me. Guess a lower number . . .

random_intro1      =Hello! What's your name?
random_intro2      =Hi, what's your name?
random_intro3      =Ah, a player has emerged from the darkness. What shall we call you?
random_intro4      =Oh, my goodness, you startled me. Who are you?
random_intro5      =I'm a computer. So, what's your name?
random_intro6      =I'm just a text file. What are you? Do you have a name?

random_playagain1  =Do you . . .  want to play again?
random_playagain2  =Want to try to beat me again?
random_playagain3  =Do you really wanna try your luck again?
random_playagain4  =Would you like to play again?
random_playagain5  =Try again? Maybe you'll have better luck . . .
random_playagain6  =Play again? I promise not to chea-- I mean, be so lucky next time . . .

random_prelude1    =Well, $player_name, I'm thinking of a number . . .  I think it's between \
  $min_target and $max_target . . .  I think I forgot it.
random_prelude2    =There is a number in my head, $player_name . . .  well, not my head. But I \
  want you to guess the number! It's between $min_target and $max_target.
random_prelude3    =Very good! $player_name, I picked a number between $min_target and \
  $max_target. Guess it!
random_prelude4    =If you guess the number I'm thinking of from $min_target to $max_target, \
  $player_name, I might give you a treasure of great endeavour . . .  if I had one.
random_prelude5    =$player_name, there is a number N such that $min_target ≤ N ≤ $max_target . . . 

random_prompt1     =Hit me! Ow! Not literally . . .    [$min_target - $max_target]
random_prompt2     =Guess my number!   [$min_target - $max_target]
random_prompt3     =I just forgot the number. Oh well, maybe if you guess, I'll remember.    [$min_target - $max_target]
random_prompt4     =What was the number again? Guess, let's see if you're close.    [$min_target - $max_target]
random_prompt5     =Try to guess my number. Bet you can't!    [$min_target - $max_target]
random_prompt6     =I bet you won't even come close to guessing my number.   [$min_target - \
  $max_target]

random_win1        =You did it! I've been foiled again . . .
random_win2        =Wow! You guessed it. How did you guess that? Are you cheating?
random_win3        =Congratulations! You guessed correctly.
random_win4        =You win!
random_win5        =You guessed my number! Dang . . .
random_win6        =I'm definitely not cheating, so I'm not surprised you could guess it so easily.

random_wrong_input1=That didn't make any sense. Could you try again?   [$min_target - $max_target]
random_wrong_input2=What are you talking about? Guess something between $min_target and $max_target.
random_wrong_input3=Huh? Guess again.    [$min_target - $max_target]
random_wrong_input4=What? Guess something else. Like, between $min_target and $max_target?
random_wrong_input5=Uhhhh . . .  maybe guess again.    [$min_target - $max_target]
random_wrong_input6=Okay, let's try typing a tasty number next time.     [$min_target - $max_target]
random_wrong_input7=Numbers . . . can you type a number?     [$min_target - $max_target]
random_wrong_input8=Uh . . .  enter something in [$min_target - $max_target] . . .
random_wrong_input9=To put it your way, "there exists some natural number N such that N ∈ \
  {$min_target, ..., $max_target} . . . "
